Our project has 3 files: 

1- The research paper.

2- the final.html -> contains codes used in R in order to get results and do some analysis after obtaining the DE and vcf files (using the tools in Galaxy. Galaxy was used with limited storage because the server in LAU was not working).

3- GATK.sh -> includes the pipeline used to get the vcf files. 


NOTE: 

The project was tested on a small sample because of the issue with the server and storage availability.
